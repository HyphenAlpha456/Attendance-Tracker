## 📷 How It Works

1. A user uploads their photo during registration 🧑‍🎓  
2. The face is encoded and saved via deep learning embeddings 🧠  
3. When the webcam is activated, it checks for face matches 🎥  
4. If matched, attendance is recorded in real time ⏱️  
5. All records are stored securely and displayed on-screen 📋
